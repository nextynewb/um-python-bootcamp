Exercise: Checking two different Lists

We have two Lists:

    blacklist = ['aniq', 'alia', 'muthu', 'ah chong']
    vip = ['asiah', 'fatihah', 'yee peng', 'thevan']

Check if name is in blacklist or vip:

    - If name is in blacklist, print "You are not allowed to enter"
    - If name is in vip, print "Welcome, {name}, VIP!"
    - If name is not in blacklist or vip, print "You are allowed to enter"

"""

while True:

    blacklist = ['aniq', 'alia', 'muthu', 'ah chong']
    vip = ['asiah', 'fatihah', 'yee peng', 'thevan']

    name = input('What is your name?')
